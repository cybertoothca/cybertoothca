# CircleCI-1.0 Configuration Example

I've not enjoyed my experiences with TravisCI and moved over to CircleCI
instead.  To get there I obviously had to configure my Ember Addons to build
efficiently in that environment.  I've created a simple gist of my CircleCI
configuration to share with any other interested parties.

Enjoy.
